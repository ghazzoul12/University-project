## ** Brownian Motion in Finance**
ðŸ“Œ **Objective:**  
Explore the concept of **Brownian motion** and its applications in finance, including **geometric and fractional Brownian motion**.  
Special focus is given to the **Hurst exponent** and its role in modeling market behavior.

ðŸ“Œ **Methods:**
- Introduction to **standard Brownian motion (Wiener process)** and its properties.
- Implementation of **geometric Brownian motion (GBM)** as a fundamental model for asset prices.
- Application of **fractional Brownian motion (fBM)** and analysis of the **Hurst component**.
- Empirical study using **Apple stock price data**.

## ** Credit and Equity Beta**
ðŸ“Œ **Objective:**  
Investigate the relationship between **credit markets and equity markets**, focusing on **Credit Default Swaps (CDS)** indices such as **CDX (North America) and iTraxx (Europe)**.  
The project examines **CDS beta** relative to equity indices and quantifies the sensitivity of **investment-grade (IG) and high-yield (HY) CDS spreads**.

ðŸ“Œ **Methods:**
- Understanding **CDS indices** as tools for hedging and speculation in credit markets.
- Computing **CDS beta** to evaluate how different CDS indices respond to equity market movements.
- Comparing **Investment-Grade (IG) and High-Yield (HY) CDS beta**, highlighting the greater volatility and risk associated with HY.
- **Key Finding:** The **beta of CDX IG to CDX HY is 3.33**, reinforcing that **HY reacts much more aggressively** to market fluctuations than IG.

ðŸ“Œ **Files available:**
- ðŸ“‚ **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ CDS beta calculations. [ðŸ”— View on GitHub](https://github.com/ghazzoul12/University-project/blob/main/Project_Creditandequitybeta.ipynb)

## ** Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI) & Aggregated Adaptive Conformal Inference (AgACI) in Finance**
ðŸ“Œ **Objective:**  
Apply **Conformal Prediction** and **Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI)** to **financial time series data**, particularly in **volatility modeling and risk estimation**.  
This project extends these methods using **eGARCH models** and explores the benefits of **Aggregated Adaptive Conformal Inference (AgACI)**.

ðŸ“Œ **Methods:**
- **Conformal Prediction** provides **prediction intervals** based on conformity scores, ensuring reliable uncertainty estimation.
- **Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI)** dynamically updates confidence intervals based on past errors, improving its adaptability to financial data.
- **eGARCH models** are implemented for volatility forecasting, with ACI used to refine prediction accuracy.
- **Aggregated ACI (AgACI)** optimally combines multiple models with different **step size parameters (Î³)** using **Bayes Optimal Aggregation (BOA)**, enhancing performance.
- **Key Finding:** **AgACI outperforms traditional eGARCH models**, providing more stable and adaptive prediction intervals for financial markets.

## ** Happiness Score Analysis**
ðŸ“Œ **Objective:**  
Analyze the **Happiness Score** of 153 countries using economic and social factors from the **Gallup World Poll (GWP)**.  
The study examines key contributors such as **GDP per capita, life expectancy, social support, and corruption level**.

ðŸ“Œ **Methods:**
- Load and clean the dataset using **R**.  
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and visualizations.  
- Implement **linear regression** and **LASSO regression** for variable selection.  
- Interpret findings and present results in **R Markdown and HTML reports**.
